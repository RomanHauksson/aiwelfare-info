# AI Welfare Info <span class="font-normal">v0.2</span>

As the capabilities of frontier AI models approach and surpass those of humans, a thorny question is becoming increasingly urgent:

<div class="text-2xl font-bold">

> What are our moral responsibilities to digital minds?

</div>

AI welfare is an emerging field dedicated to exploring this question, researching the possibility of AI systems that are morally relevant – because they're phenomenally conscious, robustly agentic, or otherwise morally significant – and developing ethical frameworks to prevent harm to such systems. This site may become home to a directory of research, organizations, people, and project ideas in the field.
